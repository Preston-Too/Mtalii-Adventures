      <h2>It's all about adventure.</h2>

        That is what Mtalii Adventures was founded upon over a couple of months
        ago, and what the company is still all about. Discovering sceneries,
        cultures, environments, cities, mountain ranges, deserts, coasts and
        jungles; exploring this amazing planet we all live on.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Mtalii Adventures, we know what makes you tick when it comes to
        holidays. It’s a desire shared by so many others. A yearning to visit
        new places and come home with a real sense of what they’re all about.
        This means delving into local traditions, cultures, cuisine, lifestyles
        – anything that contributes to its unique identity. At the same time, we
        always remember that we are only guests. So we travel courteously and
        respectfully, in smaller groups to minimise our impact, to ensure that
        every Mtalii Adventures holiday is a beneficial experience for everyone
        involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a philosophy we take with us around the world, helping you reach
        some incredible destinations on 150+ itineraries across over 30 separate
        counties. We also strive to provide as much flexibility and choice as we
        possibly can, making it simple for you to experience a very different
        holiday.
      </p>

      <h2>With Mtalii you're in safe hands</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        All our office staff have a passion for travel and adventure, and
        between us we’ve notched up experience that spans 171 different
        sceneries – all of which means we know how to give you the best
        experience when you travel with us. We’ve even won awards for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s not all. In their former lives, our team members have been
        professional archaeologists, wildlife guides, overland drivers, mountain
        leaders, bird watchers, diving and ski specialists and mountain bike
        gurus – and we use our expertise to give you the very best adventure
        possible. Extensive planning, research, fact-finding and training are
        just some of the ways this expertise comes through in your adventure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is no exaggeration to say that our tour leaders can make a world of
        difference to the enjoyment of your holiday – so we choose them
        carefully. The result is that, in 2020, 97% of travellers said they
        would recommend us to a friend. Where possible, we train and employ
        local leaders because they can provide invaluable insights that enrich
        the trip. What’s more, this investment in local staff really helps us
        benefit both them and their community.
