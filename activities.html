              here at Mtalii Adventures, whereby they get to interact with the
              animals and have a good experience as they are taken round the

              activity. It can be done with the naked eye, through a visual enhancement device like binoculars and
              telescopes, or by listening for animal sounds. Many national parks champion wildlife viewing as a key
              activity.
